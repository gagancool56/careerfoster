                            <p>Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is the best practice with the highest profile in modern Human Resource
management. It represents openness to hiring and doing business with others regardless of race,
ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical ability or attributes,
religious values, political beliefs and more.
Many factors drive this commitment at today’s companies. The biggest factor is dynamic change in
workforce demographics. That is closely followed by globalization, fierce competition for talent, and
the changing needs of companies, industries and consumers. If you’re looking for transcendent
